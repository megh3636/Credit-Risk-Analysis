# Credit-Risk-Analysis

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict credit card account defaults and manage credit risk. By using models such as XGBoost and Neural Networks, the goal is to classify credit accounts that are likely to default and help financial institutions manage risk more effectively. The project compares multiple strategies and evaluates the impact of various thresholds on default rates and revenue generation.
